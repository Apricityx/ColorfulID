### A simple plugin that makes players able to choose their own nickname color by commands below:

```
!!color <color>
```

## BEWARE: This plugin works by making players join different teams, please make sure your server doesn't rely on /team command.

## After enabling this plugin, you need to run the following command to initialize:
```
!!color install
```

This will create several teams for players to join and adjust their nickname color.

When you don't need this plugin anymore, run the following command to remove the teams:

```
!!color uninstall
```
