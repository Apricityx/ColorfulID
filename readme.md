A simple plugin that makes players able to choose their own nickname color by commands below:

```
!!color <color>
```

## BEWARE: This plugin works by making players join different teams, please make sure your server doesn't rely on /team command.

## After enabling this plugin, you need to run the following command to initialize:
```
!!color install
```

This will create several teams for players to join and adjust their nickname color.

When you don't need this plugin anymore, run the following command to remove the teams:

```
!!color uninstall
```

---------

## 注意：此插件原理是通过让玩家加入不同颜色的队伍来实现，请注意你的服务器是否依赖/team命令。

## 在启用插件后需要执行以下命令来初始化：

```
!!color install
```

这会新增若干个队伍，通过加入队伍来调整名字的颜色。

当不在需要此插件时，执行以下命令来删除队伍：

```
!!color uninstall
```
